WiFire is an internet of things (IoT) detector that is able to detect smoke, combustible gas leaks, flames, and monitors changes in temperature and sound. WiFire's device is meant to be placed in multiple areas around the school - and all of these devices monitors dangers and sends data up to a secure cloud. WiFire's app alerts administrators to the potential danger in their locations with their very own mobile phone, allowing them to monitor their school in the palm of their hand
